### **System Information Script**


This project contains a simple Bash script that prints basic system details such as the current user, date and time, hostname, operating system version, CPU model, and memory information. It is written using strict mode (set -euo pipefail) for better error handling and reliable results across Linux systems.


##### Key Points:


* Written in Bash with strict mode for robustness.
* Provides essential system details in a clean format.
* Can be extended to include disk usage, network info, or log details.

* Easy to run with:

Â 	
   chmod +x system\_info.sh
  
    ./system-info.sh
